Problem Statement:
People with disabilities often face challenges in their quality of life experiences. Being able to go out and enjoy certain activities can be difficult not only because of their disabilities but also because of locations that do not accommodate their needs. There needs to be a centralized place to find restaurants, events, or social activities that recognize their accommodations for people with disabilities, and consumers can back up what the businesses claim. 

Project Overview
Bit by Bit recognizes that people with disabilities should have an app that caters to their needs, making locations more accessible. By creating a web application that allows people with disabilities to find places such as restaurants or stores with a high level of accessibility, we hope to increase the quality of disabled users' experiences across different areas of life. To create an application that meets these needs, we will implement location services to view the accessibility level of a specific location. Additionally, our application will receive user input to confirm the validity of a location's accessibility. Our application will feature an intuitive interface that enables users with disabilities to obtain accurate accessibility reviews for any location they choose.

Goals
Create a web application that allows users to find handicap accessible locations. 
Create an online social atmosphere that enables users to share information.
Allow users to comment or review locations that claim to offer disability services. . 

Stretch Goals
Allow users to add images to the reviews/comments.
Make the web application completely mobile-friendly. 
Incorporate AI to review the authenticity of reports. 

Specifications
The application will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end structure. PHP for the backend structure, Google Firebase for the database structure, and perhaps some Google APIs for individual services like locations or messaging. The application will be optimized to scale across various devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers.  -->
